    "#Q5.Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row (record) in a table.\n",
    "2)I must contain unique values and cannot have NULL values.\n",
    "3)Primary keys enforce entity integrity in a relational database, ensuring that each record in a table is \n",
    "  uniquely identifiable.\n",
    "4)Typically, primary keys are created using the CREATE TABLE statement or ALTER TABLE statement.\n",
    "5)Example : CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    first_name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "    last_name VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "Foreign Key:\n",
    "\n",
    "1)A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link between data in two tables.\n",
    "2)It creates a relationship between two tables by referencing the primary key of another table.\n",
    "3)Foreign keys enforce referential integrity, ensuring that the data in the referencing table (child table) \n",
    "  corresponds to the data in the referenced table (parent table).\n",
    "4)Foreign keys can have NULL values, but they must match an existing value in the referenced table or be NULL.\n",
    "5)Typically, foreign keys are defined when creating or altering tables using the FOREIGN KEY constraint.\n",
    "6) EXAMPLE : \n",
    "            CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
